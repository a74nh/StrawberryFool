StrawberryFool
==============

A twist on a recent classic.


StrawberryFool was born of the idea: What if in Flappy Bird you moved the pipes and the bird moved by itself?

With far too many features for such a simple game,
Strawberry Fool is my first libgdx game and suffers from far too much thinking and overthought.

Help the Strawberry reach the rich creamy desert at the bottom of the glass by pushing away the Spoons and Forks out to capture the poor fruit and eat it.
As the Strawberry get closer to the fruit the action gets faster and more frantic. How long can you survive?
